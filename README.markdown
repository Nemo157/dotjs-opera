..................... dotjs ........................

dotjs is an extension that executes JavaScript files
in `./js` based on their filename.

See the main [dotjs page](http://defunkt.io/dotjs/)
or [repository](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs)
for more information.

## This Repository

This repository contains the code to allow Opera to
utilise the dotjs server, coming soon to an Opera
Extensions List near you.

## Requires

- [dotjs server](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs)
- Opera

## Install it

Download [jQuery](http://jquery.com) into
~/.js/jquery.js (minified is fine).

Then simply drag the config.xml onto Opera to
install in developer mode.  Will be packaged and
available from [the Opera extension
list](https://addons.opera.com) soon.
